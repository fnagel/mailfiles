# TYPO3 Mailfiles

Simple TYPO3 CMS Extension to upload files and send download links via email.


## Description

This extension provides a simple form with a Pluploadfe upload widget, a simple text input
used as mail subject, a textarea for adding a message, a "auto-send" checkbox and a submit button.

If the "auto-send" checkbox is checked the form will be auto submitted once uploading is completed.

@wowaTYPO3 did an introduction of this extension in his Twitch channel, take a look here:
